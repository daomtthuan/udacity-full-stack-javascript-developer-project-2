Image Processing API

## Introduction

### Overview

This project is an API for image processing. It provides the following functionalities:

- Upload an image
- Get an image by name
- Get all images
- Delete an image by name
- Resize an image

### Functionality

## Result obtained

Using TypeScript, Node.js, Express, and Sharp, I have created an API that can process images.
The API can upload an image, get an image by name, get all images, delete an image by name, and resize an image.
Beside that, I using Dependency Injection for architecture of the project.

I also use the:

- Repository pattern
- Service pattern
- Middleware pattern
- Decorator pattern
- Singleton pattern
- Factory pattern

I wrote unit tests for the API endpoints and the services. Using Jest for testing.
